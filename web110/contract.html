	<h1>Diedra Lawton's Web110 Course Contract</h1>
	<br>
	<p>I, <b>Diedra Lawton</b> agree to abide by the terms in my summer web110_85 Internet/Web Fundamentals with my instructor, D.I. Von Briesen<br> I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world, and I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.<br> I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not log ins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as an absense.<br> Signed: Diedra Lawton, 5/30/2020
