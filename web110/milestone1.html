	<h1>Project Milestone #1</h1>
	<h2>Weekends With D and J</h2>
	<h3> A Lifestyle Blog featuring Food and Travel </h3>
	<p>Catch all the details below</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li><b>What is the purpose of this site?</b>
			<br>
		The purpose of this site it to provide a reference of places to travel as a family, which is my case or to travel alone. Many times when people are creating an itinerary for their vactions they are often looking for the top things to do in that particular destination so my site will provide real feedback from different restuarants and attractions with a seperate section for places that are specifically child friendly. </li>
		
		<li><b>What do you want the website to accomplish? What opportunity, problem or issue is your site addressing?</b><br>
			
		I want my site to be a go to place for travelers. Often times people don't take the time to travel across the country and see what it has to offer. They also don't do this with children either due to thinking that traveling is overly expensive. My site will provide some inexpensive things to do and places to eat so after seeing my site and seeing that it can be done people will change their mind about traveling.</li>
		
		
		<li><b>Who is your intended audience? Be Specific</b><br>
			
			My intended audience is millenials and millenial families. Typically between the ages of 22 and 38. This is my age range and this is the range I think my site will appeal to the most.</li>
		
		<li><b>List at least two related or similar sites found on the web</b>
			<br>
			Similar sites that i frequent are Trip Advisor and Thrillist. Trip advisor goes a bit more in depth with the reviews and hotels and Thrillist is more so for the millenial without children but still a great source.
		</li>
		
		<li><b>What type of content might be included in your site? Be specific</b>
			<br>
			The content I will include will be my list of top places to go in each city that I post. This includes attractions, parks, museums etc etc. I will also pair that with my top restaurants to try as well as prices for everything. I will briefly touch on hotel selections and ways to travel around each city that are affordable. Most of these trips will be prices for a weekend stay. The childrens section will be places that are kid friendly as well as prices. This is the perspective of a single mom with one child but the reader should modify it to fit their needs.
